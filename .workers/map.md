# Map — PGlite workload harness

Static evidence index. Not a queue: no owners, no claims, no priorities.

## Target

| Fact | Value |
|------|-------|
| Target repo | `electric-sql/pglite` (fork: `workersio/pglite-workload`) |
| Pinned ref | `1a4cce1ab9ad5e13cbef9072ea005046f153ad9b` (main, 2026-07-10) |
| System under test | `@electric-sql/pglite` 0.5.4 — WASM Postgres, single-connection, embeddable |
| SUT delivery | vendored npm tarball → extracted to `.workers/vendor/pglite` by `.workers/build.sh` (offline, no monorepo toolchain) |
| wio project | `kn75132e9yw801hsybeayv40w58a86e1` ("pglite-workload", prod, ready) |
| wio branch | `main` |
| Runtime | node scripts on the alpine-node image driving the extracted package |

## Reality notes

- PGlite is a full Postgres compiled to WASM, run **single-connection,
  single-threaded** in-process. No client/server, no wire protocol between the
  app and the DB. Concurrency defects are therefore about *interleaving of
  async JS calls into one DB*, transaction state, and persistence — not
  multi-client races.
- Persistence backends: in-memory (default), IndexedDB (browser),
  filesystem/`dataDir` (node), and OPFS. Durability promises live on the
  persistent backends; the durability question is "does an acked write survive
  a reload of the same dataDir?"
- `db.query`/`db.exec` are serialized internally through a single queue;
  `db.transaction(fn)` gives an interactive tx with a callback. Reentrancy and
  the interplay of `transaction`, `exec` (multi-statement), and prepared
  statements are prime interleaving surfaces.
- Live queries, extensions (pgvector, pgmq recently added — d4fb8ec), and the
  `/dump`+`loadDataDir` snapshot path are additional promise surfaces.

## Guest reality (executor)
- Guest node **v20.15.1**; box node v22. Runs execute the committed git tree at
  `/workspace`; gitignored build.sh output is absent — workloads extract the
  vendored tarball to `/tmp` via `.workers/workloads/_run.sh` (see executor-notes).
- **Guest init: RESOLVED (2026-07-10).** `PGlite.create()` wedged in the sim on
  THREE event-loop dependencies: async WASM *compile*, async `fs.readFile`, and
  the async `WebAssembly.instantiate(module, imports)` task (flaky even with a
  pre-compiled Module). Fix (`.workers/workloads/_pglite.mjs`): pre-compile the
  WASM modules + pass the FS image as an `fsBundle` Blob, AND monkeypatch the
  global `WebAssembly.instantiate` to `new WebAssembly.Instance()` (fully
  synchronous). Every workload MUST build the DB via `_pglite.mjs`. Proven by
  `probe_ops` (create + queries + exec + transaction all `succeeded` in-guest).
  query/exec/transaction workloads now give clean guest verdicts.
- **BLOCKER #2: RESOLVED (2026-07-10).** The LISTEN/NOTIFY path starves the sim's
  MACROTASK queue (timers die) — `db.listen`/`pg_notify` themselves work; only a
  subsequent `setTimeout` wedges. Fix: notify + live workloads wait via a bounded
  MICROTASK drain (`await Promise.resolve()`), since delivery is `queueMicrotask`.
  notify + live baselines now green in-guest; all 4 findings guest-capable.
  Details: `runs/executor-notes.md §RESOLVED BLOCKER #2`.

## Areas

| Key | Title | Focus | Status |
|-----|-------|-------|--------|
| transactions | Transactions | tx blocks, rollback, atomicity, single-conn state machine | active |
| live-queries | Live Queries | subscriptions, incremental diffs, subscriber lifecycle | active |
| durability | Durability & Persistence | acked write survives reopen/crash (memory + nodefs) | active |
| query-exec | Query & Exec Semantics | multi-statement atomicity, post-error recovery, param/type fidelity | active |
| concurrency | Concurrency & Teardown | close races, in-flight settling, buffer bounds | active |
| notify | LISTEN / NOTIFY | delivery to exactly the emit-time listener set | active |
| snapshot | Snapshot (dump/loadDataDir) | faithful round-trip of DB state | active |
| extensions | Extensions & Sync | bundled extensions + pglite-sync apply path | active |

## Module reconciliation (breadth floor, 2026-07-10)

`packages/pglite/src/` modules, each inside an area's loci or explicitly parked:

- `base.ts`, `pglite.ts` — transactions / query-exec / concurrency (core).
- `types.ts`, `errors.ts`, `templating.ts`, `parse.ts` — query-exec.
- `fs/*` (base, nodefs, memoryfs, index, tarUtils) — durability / snapshot.
  `fs/idbfs.ts`, `fs/opfs-ahp.ts` — **parked: unreachable-in-guest** (browser
  backends; no recipe vendored — a browser recipe would unlock them).
- `live/*` — live-queries. `worker/index.ts` — **parked: needs-harness**
  (worker-thread RPC; a second concurrency surface, standing candidate).
- `extensionUtils.ts`, `contrib/` — extensions.
- `argsParser.ts` — config resolution (start-param parsing); NOT parked — a
  durability/exec workload must exercise real start-param resolution, not a
  hard-pinned config (producer.md breadth floor). Tracked under query-exec/durability.
- `initdb.ts`, `initdbModFactory.ts` — durability (startup/reload path).
- `index.ts` — **parked: re-exports only**. `interface.ts`, `definitions/` —
  **parked: type declarations only**. `postgresMod.ts` — **parked: vendored
  WASM glue**. `polyfills/` — **parked: environment shims**. `utils.ts`,
  `extensionUtils.ts` helpers — covered transitively.

No module is in neither state; breadth floor satisfied for this refresh.

## Promoted findings

| Key | Severity | Class | Upstream | Status |
|-----|----------|-------|----------|--------|
| live-subscriber-isolation | correctness (3) | live-query subscriber teardown | pending dossier | RED confirmed (local; guest re-publish in flight after BLOCKER #2 fix) — `unsubscribe(cb)` removes ALL subscribers + tears down state; all 3 variants (query/changes/incrementalQuery). `runs/live-subscriber-isolation-unsub-one.md` |
| tx-closed-handle | correctness / data-integrity (3) | tx handle writes after end | pending dossier | RED **GUEST-CONFIRMED** — baseline green (6/6), sql-after-rollback (r1/r2) + after-throw (t1-t4) red; `tx.sql` never guards + `closed` never set on throw; retained handle persists writes. `runs/tx-closed-handle.md` |
| notify-quoted-unlisten | correctness (2) | quoted-channel unsubscribe | pending dossier | RED confirmed (local; guest re-publish in flight after BLOCKER #2 fix) — disposer double-normalizes a quoted channel (toPostgresName not idempotent); callback keeps firing after unsubscribe. `runs/notify-quoted-unlisten.md` |
| tx-atomicity-recovery | availability (2) | reentrant deadlock | pending dossier | RED **GUEST-CONFIRMED** — baseline green (8/8), reentrant watchdog-red (10/10); parent-handle db.query inside a transaction callback deadlocks the instance (non-reentrant mutex). `runs/tx-atomicity-recovery-reentrant.md` |
